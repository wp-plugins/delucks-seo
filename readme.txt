Easy SEO for noobs and experts: The plugin is your helping hand in WordPress on page search engine optimization.

![Why DELUCKS SEO?](http://delucks.com/envato-images/Envato-usp-short-2.png)
We created a new WordPress SEO Plugin because we are very sophisticated professional [SEOs from Germany](https://delucks.com). But in the past we were not satisfied with the existing SEO plugins:

* The problem with other existing SEO plugins is that they don’t put emphasis  on all SEO aspects and therefore need to be extended through other SEO plugins.
* The more WordPress (SEO) plugins you need, the less safe, less fast and less compatible your website becomes.
* So, having only a semi good SEO plugin is not only less successful, it can also worsen your website.

That’s why we developed the most extensive tool for WordPress SEO: the DELUCKS SEO Plugin for WordPress. Besides the basic functions other SEO plugins have, our __WordPress SEO plugin contains amongst all other “standard” SEO functions__

* rating stars und social sharing buttons for your __social SEO__,
* schema data for the __local seo__,
* image compression for __performance optimization__.

Thus, our plugin contains all SEO-relevant functions it doesn’t need to be extended through other plugins and due to that it makes your website or blog faster, more stable and more safe.


*__In short: our seo plugin makes your website more successful.__*

Besides that, our plugin is very easy to use for everybody – from the professional SEO expert to the beginner. It respects the German data privacy law (one of the most severe ones in the world) and is optimized for multi lingual usage: it’s in English and German and works with every language, you set up in your WPML plugin. Our plugin is roaarrr’some

*Basic: __Metadata__*

With the DELUCKS SEO plugin you will be able to set your metadata in every language easy as 1, 2, 3. Verify your website for Google, Bing, Pinterest and Alexa. Choose your settings, follow/nofollow and index/noindex for categories, taxonomies and even pagination.

Metadata is not visible upfront on your Website. This data is deposited on your website source code and is used as title and description for each content on your website, which is being listed for search results. With your website ownership you can also check the sitemap (from the same called module) at Google, Bing and other services, which is very recommended for a well working website.


*Basic: __Sitemaps__*

The DELUCKS SEO plugin gives you the possibility to edit any post type regarding their priority and frequenzy. Publish your Google News Sitemap with just __ONE CLICK__!

Sitemaps are blueprints of your website. You give search engines the information on which level of your site structure is a certain information given. There are 4 types of sitemaps: The standard sitemap for all regular content on your website. In the standard sitemap all regular contents listed – ie blog posts, pages, etc.


*Basic: __URL optimization__*

The DELUCKS SEO plugin removes all stopwords from your URLs, we even got them ready for you – with just ONE CLICK! Make any post, page or custom post type your 404 page


*Professional: __Breadcrumbs__*

DELUCKS SEO breadcrumbs are ultra customizeable and multilanguage ready. Use them with a Wordpress shortcode, PHP shortcode or add them with a widget to your website!

Breadcrumbs are very useful: not only your website visitor but also those to you’re your website appears in the search results are given the navigation level of your website at that current search. Breadcurmbs are like those in Hansel and Gretel: With them your vistors will always find their way back to your home page.


*Professional: __Rating__*

Stars, hearts, ticks, thumbs, throphies, a diamond and many more rating icons are offered by the DELUCKS SEO plugin. Choose your icon, define the colors, add text and your ratings are __ready to GO__!

Amazon is the best example on how the visitors opinion helps the search to improve it’s results. But not only shop items can be reviewed, but blog posts can and should be reviewed, because your readers are interested in good content. You can decide if your visitors should only rate your content or if they should also be able to write a review in your comments. Maybe you also want to improve through the reviews, too. This shows Google that you count on your visitors opinion and their opinion helps the search engine to improve its results. So that’s why ratings and reviews are that important.


*Professional: __Social sharing__*

Make your sharing buttons appear in any way you desire! DELUCKS SEO plugin offers you a live editor to style any of your sharing buttons.

Search engines use reactions of social media users to get a human feedback for relevant content. So the better and more natural your website feedback (e.g. social shares) grows, the more important your website will be graded.



*__And there’s still more:__*

* __Statistics__ module and dashboard widget – always have an eye on your visitors, with the DELUCKS statistics widget on your Wordpress dashboard, only visible to the user groups you want!
* __Image optimization__ to speed up your page – to lower copyright risks, you can activate a field to fill out the author!
* __Microdata__ – peculiar information that helps search engines and social media to interprete your websites’ information
